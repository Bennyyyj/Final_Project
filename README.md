# Final_Project
This project is a terminal-based implementation of the classic puzzle game Minesweeper, written in Python. The game challenges the player to uncover all safe tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Players can flag suspected mines and reveal tiles to deduce the positions of bombs based on numeric clues.
